# CDP Protocol Network Project

This project demonstrates how to use **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)** to discover connected devices in a multi-switch network.  
The network consists of **2 Multilayer Switches (MLS)** and **4 Access Switches** connected in a hierarchical topology.

## âœ… Project Notes
- CDP successfully discovered all neighbors between Core and Access Switches.
- Inter-VLAN routing is configured on MLS devices.
- Trunk ports are using **802.1Q encapsulation**.
- Each Access Switch belongs to a specific VLAN and is reachable via its MLS.
