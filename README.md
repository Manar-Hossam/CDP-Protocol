# CDP Protocol Network Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)** in a multi-switch and multi-VLAN network using two Multilayer Switches (MLS).  
The network is designed to allow **device discovery**, **VLAN segmentation**, and **inter-VLAN routing**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Network Topology
![Network Topology](topology.png)

*(The detailed topology image is attached with the project)*

- **MLS0 (Core-1)** connected to Switch0 & Switch1
- **MLS1 (Core-2)** connected to Switch2 & Switch3
- Each VLAN has a dedicated host to test inter-VLAN communication
- CDP protocol is used to discover connected devices

## üîπ VLAN Configuration

| VLAN | Name       | IP on MLS        |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 10   | VLAN0010  | 192.168.10.1    |
| 20   | VLAN0020  | 192.168.20.1    |
| 30   | VLAN0030  | 192.168.30.1    |
| 40   | VLAN0040  | 192.168.40.1    |
